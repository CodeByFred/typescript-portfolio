            My career started with a curiosity about human behaviour, which led me to
            study psychology in the US. That experience sharpened my communication skills
            and gave me a unique way of understanding people, something I now bring into
            the tech world.

            After moving to Australia, I studied electrical engineering to broaden my
            interests. It was during a programming course that everything clicked. That
            spark turned into a new career goal, and I shifted gears to pursue an honours
            degree in software engineering.
          </p>

          <p className={classes.text}>
            These days, Iâ€™m blending behavioural insights with technical skills to build
            intuitive, human-focused solutions that aim to make a difference.
