            My career journey started with an interest in human behaviour, which led me to
            pursue a psychology degree in the United States. That foundation sharpened my
            communication skills and gave me a unique lens for understanding people â€” a
            perspective I now bring into tech.
          </p>

          <p className={classes.text}>
            After moving to Australia, I studied electrical engineering to broaden my
            interests. It was during a programming course that everything clicked. That
            spark turned into a new career goal, and I shifted gears to pursue an honours
            degree in software engineering.
          </p>

          <p className={classes.text}>
            Now, I mix behavioural insight with technical skills to build intuitive,
            human-centered solutions that aim to make a difference.
